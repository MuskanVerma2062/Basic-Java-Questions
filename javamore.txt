Ques. Difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
	The string is immutable and final in Java, so whenever we do String manipulation, it creates a new String. String manipulations are resource consuming, so java provides two utility classes for String manipulations â€“ StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer operations are thread-safe and synchronized where StringBuilder operations are not thread-safe. So in a multi-threaded environment, we should use StringBuffer but in the single-threaded environment, we should use StringBuilder.
StringBuilder performance is fast than StringBuffer because of no overhead of synchronization.
